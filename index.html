          <p>Hey there! Welcome to my Github page. My name is Simon and I'm in the process of transiting to become a web developer.
            In fact, you're looking at my first web page that I created for an assignment at UC Berkely Coding Bootcamp.
            Please feel free to explore my Portfolo section where I host photos about me. If you're interest in learning
            more about me, please feel free to contact me through the Contact page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, let's talk about my career. In 2015, I graduated from University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. One week after
            I stepped down from the graduation ceremony stage, I decided to take the road trip to San Francisco by myself.
            Fortunate for me, I got to work in a start-up company called OneMob one week after I arrived as a software QA
            Analyst, which I had no idea what software QA does. Three years passed, still employed at OneMob, I'm challenging
            myself to become a web developer.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The move from Minnesota to San Francisco is probably the most significant move of my life. It definded my career. It set
            me into the mindset of a grown man. One year after living in San Francico, I got married. My wife, Mimi, gave
            me a Son who we named Theodore. Now looking back, I'm truly blessed.
